# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Practice

This repository is a personal collection of solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms problems. It serves as a log of my practice and a resource for revision. The problems are sourced from popular competitive programming platforms and curated lists.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:

*   Document my journey in learning and mastering DSA.
*   Provide a structured way to store and review solutions.
*   Create a personal knowledge base of common patterns and techniques.
*   Share solutions with the community for learning and discussion.
